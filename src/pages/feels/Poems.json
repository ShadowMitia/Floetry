{
title: "A Time to believe",
author: "B.J. Morbitzer.",
text:"To believe is to know that
every day is a new beginning.
Is to trust that miracles happen,
and dreams really do come true.

To believe is to see angels
dancing among the clouds,
To know the wonder of a stardust sky
and the wisdom of the man in the moon.

To believe is to know the value of a nurturing heart,
The innocence of a child's eyes
and the beauty of an aging hand,
for it is through their teachings we learn to love.

To believe is to find the strength
and courage that lies within us
When it's time to pick up
the pieces and begin again.

To believe is to know
we are not alone,
That life is a gift
and this is our time to cherish it.

To believe is to know
that wonderful surprises are just
waiting to happen,
And all our hopes and dreams are within reach.

If only we believe. ",

feeling: "Inspired"

title: "A Gift",
author: "Kathryn Starbuck",
text:"Who is that creature
and who does he want?
Me, I trust. I do not
attempt to call out his
name for fear he will
tread on me. What do
you believe, he asks.

That we all want to be
alone, I reply, except when
we do not; that the world
was open to my sorrow
and ate most of it; that
today is a gift and I am
ready to receive you.",
emotion: "Happy"
feeling: "Thankful"

{
title: "In the shadow of shades lost",
author: "JS Carie",
text:"Home and contentment are synonymous
The desire to reach,
while innate or evident
quiet or curious
keeps a continuum over discrepant cultures, the world over
An opulence of love and warmth
Having one ingredient can make fertile the other
One without the match, make an ordinary or secondary batch
Making one rich with joy, their other can be broke and remote seeking satisfaction

Home is not a location
or bricks of residence
But a written word in deep established sentiment
An atmosphere cloaked in the unfalter
The taking of arms to conclude their hold
developed in elements of the affectionate
No disaster, constructed or natural
could alter

As I am now,
locked in the shadow of shades lost
surrendering independent power in a momentary yield,
On hands and knees, bloodshot and in need of a shield...
In need of my one...
the imperative relevance of feeling her
That selfish influential significance that creates safe harbor at journeys end
Generated by the glow of resolve
in the home of her arms contentment.
",

//ASHAMED POEMS
{
title: "I wondered lonely as a cloud",
author: "William Wordsworth",
text:"I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed – and gazed – but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.",
emotion: "Ashamed"
feeling: "Isolated"

title: "Pathetic Cries of a Lonely Man",
author: "Jordan Rowan",
text:"Drinks below the summer skies
Love and loss hidden in your eyes
There's a future in there, I know
Send me a sigh of at least a sign
Whatever it is, honey, I'll make it mine
I just wish you didn't have to go

Came along before the storm fell
Wherever you are, I wish you well
If it's a million miles or down the road
Letters, gifts, and flower lace
Picture frames with your smiling face
I just wish you didn't have to go

Speak to me, don't make me guess
I did something wrong and I'll confess
I'd like to say I'm sorry so you know
Tired winds blow away my tired cries
Of whispered hellos and goodbyes
I just wish you didn't have to go

Long ago, before I knew your name
I was stuck and lost in a foreign place
There was still a whole world left to show
Stars would fall with a wish to say
Now they're all wished away
I'm left to wish you didn't have to go

title: "Questioning Spring",
author: "PJ Poesy",
text:"Stars jostling whatever wishes
Nets cast upon heedless fishes
To do or not to do the dishes
Just is what is all this show biz

Putting flowers in a vase
Something that might give you pause
All that is and ever was
Much to much such harm caused

To be still and to never utter
Chrysalis' desire to ever flutter
Simple wanting and none the other
Bind a dream and watch it smother

How should Spring be so cruel?
Fledgling discarded as a fool
Not all adhere to golden rule
Who'll you'll find inferior saccule?",
emotion: "Ashamed"
feeling: "Inferior"

//ANXIOUS POEMS

{
title: "Traffic Light",
author: "Linda Grantham",
text:"This traffic light inside my head
Is always green and never red.
My thoughts, my dreams, and all my fears,
They all speed past my listening ears.

I close my eyes to block it out,
But inside my head they rush about.
I take a breath to slow it down,
But upon my face appears a frown.

My heart beats fast,
But my breathing slows.
I breathe in life
Then out it goes.

My body's numb,
Yet I feel my tears.
I've lost count of the days,
The months, and the years.

This traffic light
Inside my head...
I'm scared of the day
When it turns red."

emotion: "Anxious"
feeling: "Afraid"

{
title: "Being Invisible",
author: "Grace Snoddy",
text:"a body filled with familiar dread
you might say my body is already dead
my head is said to be quite fretful
took moments of quietude for granted;
and now i’m constantly regretful

the restlessness of my emotions
address my state of mind
and the distressed thoughts run around my head like guerrilas
they know they are running out of time
my jittery heart runs rampant
like a broken clock
and my only wish is for all of this to stop

the apprehension creates a detonation
a complete eradication of my elation
because my body is filled with familiar dread",
emotion: "Anxious"
feeling: "Nervous"
}

{
title: "Nicole Ashley",
author: "White Noise",
text:"I'm in a vulnerable state of mind
Static screams in heavy machinery
A screen of the world in a room of thousands of sounds and lights
It's black and white
It's silent and noisy
It's dark and light
I'm in a vulnerable state of mind
But all of it is white noise",
emotion: "Anxious"

{
title: "Worried About My Heart",
author: "Deborah T Johnson",
text:"I am worried about my heart
I worry about my heart.
Not the ticking,
The ticking,
The tick, tick, ticking
But the breaking,
The breaking,
The break, break, breaking
Like glass
Cracking
It stays out there,
I hold it in my hand...
You? Do you? Do you want it?
I ask?
How about you? Do you? Do you want it?
I ask again.
I worry about my heart.
I am worried about my heart.",

//ANGRY POEMS

{
title: "defensive",
author: "Sarah Sisson",

My skin is weathered.
My actions are defensive

heart to the past.",

{
title: "Burning Incense",
author: "B Elizabeth G",
text:"When I see things that is so inhumane
I just have to close my eyes, and shake my head
I am part of a team there,
but I am not happy to be on board
A failing system that’s ruthless
So I put on my gloves,
and do as much as I can
Else I would be living that lie.

When I see things that is so inhumane
I just tighten my jaws and shake my head
To the things that disgust me the most
I burn incense as a symbol of prayer for the helpless",

{
title: "The Flames Of a Mind",
author: "Stephanie Rose",
text:"The flames they rise up inside of me
an inferno of words, all screaming
fighting
to be the first to break my outer shell
to be the first to break me
to make me let one slip,
to form a *****, running down my face
inviting people to pull it open.
and as curiosity consumes most,
that one inferno risen word
will be the end of me",

{
title: "The Fallen Poet",
author: "George W",
text:"Shadows, fall from the east
Winter show, white meadows,
Compelling words lost, in a silent world
Beautiful, Bloomingdale is how it goes
Apocalypto-- my very own limbo
Alone in a field of corpses-
A field of men, women and broken pens,
Images of angels fallen to their knees

A piece of space, of solitude
The sun a wasted disease
The more I prayed the worse I felt,
Lord, I came before - broken and alone

Heaven sees the secret inside
Lost I may be, yet you see
Offended me, I no longer sing
I wait till all is asleep
My ink is dry, a broken poet, with nowhere to go
Lost in the shadows of snow, frozen like ice
A sheet of paper, with no meaning, no words

My friends, my comrades, how easily one forgets

Like a game of chess, I panicked
Made all the right and wrong moves
I lost my way, staggered across
Love comes and love goes
My heart weaker than, weak
I don't know how I survived before,
After turning the other cheek
I was no longer whole, forsaken myself endlessly
I was lost, could not even count on myself

Guidance, I ignored no one believed what's become of me
Alone, I stood in old footsteps after falling down

At times end, I found nothing could put me back where I belong
It's time to get back on offense,
Walk through the new, refreshing old footprints",
emotion: "Angry"
feeling: "Offended"

//HURT POEMS

{
title: "Feelings Of Abandonment",
author: "Angela Fernatt",
text:"I keep looking for comfort from you
I sit and wonder if your love is true
You see me crying
Inside you have to know I'm dying
Don't you see these tears
Don't you see the hurt from so many years
The little girl that was hurt so bad
Is now 30 years old and utterly sad
No one to listen or even to talk to
Recalling memories that hurt me through and through
The things you ask of me
It triggers a memory
Memories I'd rather forget
Memories embedded in my mind, completely set
The hurt, the pain and anger won't go away
I wonder who "loves me" and will turn their back today
I can't explain how I feel inside
Feelings of abandonment rush in like the tide
Ghosts haunt me no matter where I go
I do love you still, that you should know
I wish you could understand
I would be there holding your hand
I would take away all your pain
So in the end, you'd have a life to gain
But for me, darkness is all I see
No happiness for this little girl is to be
The adult lives her life
Taking on happiness, sorrow and strife
I hope someday you'll understand
Someday I hope you'll be here to comfort me and hold my hand
Until that day all I feel is punishment
Along with those never-ending feelings of abandonment

and she lived in your eyes …
She could see green, greener grass and blue, bluer skies.

I once knew girl
and my soul adored her so …
But tell me now where, just where did she go?

I once knew a girl
and her voice, so proud …
All at once like thunder and soft, softest cloud.

I once knew a girl
and her light, it shined like the sun …
She reveled in challenge and she took every one.
I once knew a girl
and my belief in her was beyond …
But tell me now where, well where has she gone?

I once knew a girl
and her brio, it was just so extreme …
Her dances were made of joyous joy and her smiles ...
of pure, purist dreams.

I once knew a girl
and her laughter, it could easily stop a war …
Her conversations so engaging and her appreciation galore.

I once knew a girl
and her heart so brave, it was always showing through …
But somehow, I can't see it now and that's why I'm asking you.

You see, I miss that girl
that once lived in your eyes.
So please, I just need to know …
That girl  …
was so very precious to me …
Tell me now …
Where, where did she go?

{
title: "The Day the World Fell Apart",
author: "Rhona McFerran",
text:"It was unseasonably
warm for Winter
sun shone bright
cool breeze blowing
but not even cold
and I was
just walking
along, not knowing
the world, as we knew it
was about to come apart
Then that piercing scream
ripped through my heart
heart pounding and
pumping, feet
pounding, running
suddenly cold all over
despite warm sunshine
tingling numbness tracing up
my spine, silent shock- unable to
speak for hours (or was it days?)
all the ways my life had changed in that
instant came home to me, cluttering my
mind, unable to find a coherent thought
everything jumbled and caught in the
maze of my brain.  Feeling insane to
actually feel relief in this tragic
moment, beyond belief... so
relieved that the world
finally mirrored
what I felt inside
what I had
had to hide for
so long- suddenly set
free, to be sad, to be me
confused, unsmiling, terrified
strangely unified with everyone
else... as they saw reason to feel it
too  Looking at me, so small and so
tragic, they had no clue that I had been
this way all along, smiles, laughter, songs
mere smokescreens to disguise, my creative
shield of lies to protect me from their eyes
their penetrating stares, pretending to
care, yet wordlessly whispering their
disapproval of all the things that
were wrong with me, namely
that I could see just who
they are and what
they've done.
But trauma
won, and
allowed my
sadness to take
form, unspoken words
unheard, yet more powerful
than any they could say- helped
me find my way back to truth and
back to me, back to some semblance
of reality... And with or without them
I learned to survive, managed to even
thrive and know it's okay to hurt, or
grieve or cry, especially when you
have good reason- but also when
you don't know a reason at all
just let the tears fall, for your
heart is sometimes smarter
than your head, feeling the
weight of things said or
the damage they've
wrought, things
you thought
you had
forgot
still stored
in your brain
fusty fragments
that remain, still
effect your emotions
your will to get up and
go, the truth cannot be
contained, tamped down
or restrained, but unfettered
must fly free- like birds in the air
swooping down, landing where
needed, like vultures circling
the decay down below, the
truth circles above and
closes in on what
must be cleaned
up, though it's
graphic
abrupt
rottenness
ripped out and
devoured from view
truth clears the carrion
of corruption, leaving only
what's true.  And I revel and
delight at this gruesome sight
weary of being the only person
smelling rotten flesh, sickened by
my plight, I welcome this barbarous
bird with all my might  Here, my Birdy
come get some! Here, you missed a bite!
So while everyone mourns this broken
world, and thinks I met a tragic fate
I carry on contentedly since my
face matches my inner state
two worlds have come into
alignment, and though
they're broken, yet in
my view- they're now
a more accurate
depiction of
what I find
to be true

title: "Maya Angelou",
author: "Caged Bird",
text:"A free bird leaps
on the back of the wind
and floats downstream
till the current ends
and dips his wing
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky.

But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.

The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn
and he names the sky his own

But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.

//SAD POEMS

{
title: "Alone",
author: "Maya Angelou",
text:"Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don’t believe I’m wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.

There are some millionaires
With money they can’t use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They’ve got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Now if you listen closely
I’ll tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan,
‘Cause nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.",

title: "You x Your Demons",
author: "Shalom Ikhena",
text:"You cannot,
I repeat, cannot,
Live your life for other people,
Nor can you live your life by others’ rules.

Because at the end of the day,
When you are left alone to your demons,
You are truly, thoroughly, alone.
And only you can see every one of your demons’ faces.

You can try to sketch a picture to someone else.
Like a person who has just been molested by a stranger explaining to the police what he did.

But only you knows his face,
And where he touched,
And how it burns.


This is why you cannot let anyone tell you to “get over it”.
This is why you cannot beat yourself up over someone’s opinion on how you should deal.

Because, I’m sorry honey, but you are alone.

You alone must sit with the devil and negotiate your sanity and soul.


So love yourself enough to explore the entirety of the aftermath
To be overly emotional if you have to.

You are free, to crumble.
If for nothing else, for the purpose of rebuilding.",

Like I have been dropped into a place and left alone.

And the people in this new place are cold as snow.

But then when I look back,

It only takes a picture or a call or a text or even a voice mail.

As soon as I get a glimpse of the people behind me.

The quality of the people propping me up.

The architecture of support around me;

Infinitely stronger than the frigidity before me.

I remember that I am not alone.

I sit here,

A small girl in an over sized chair.
And that is all you see.

You do not see the 10,000 people I come with, cheering me on, saying;

"You can do this,"

"Forgive yourself,"

"Try again."
